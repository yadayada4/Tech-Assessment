2. I worked in VS Code because the interface is nice and helps me find issues with my code quickly. I chose Python to write the program because of its simplicity, versatility, rich ecosystem of libraries, and strong community support. It seemed like the best all-around choice for this specific task and I have previous experience with it as well. I chose Selenium because I had previously used it to scrape websites so I felt comfortable with it and also because it could accomplish all of the tasks I needed it to for this assessment and more. I also used ChatGPT to automate repetitive tasks, enhance my code, and to speed up things like generating the correct XPaths, CSS selectors, ect…


3. Overall, I felt like the project went really well! I was able to scrape each element with relative ease. It didn’t feel stressful, but it was more fun than anything! Making multiple versions of the project was fun and challenged the way I think about solving problems in the future.


4. There wasn’t anything major that didn’t go well. I did end up making too many duplicates of the project which confused me at times. My workspace and folders need to be more organized in the future.


5. Overall this was a fun assessment! I enjoyed playing around with the different ways I could approach this problem. I took a couple of different approaches to scraping the website. I wrote code that just took advantage of the ease of simply changing the product number in the URL and also wrote code that could scrape the products from the website(to go through all 5 pages).
